A simple plugin with a widget and [shortcode] that displays any number of your Google Books bookshelves including custom made bookshelves.

== Description ==

This is a simple wordpress plugin (in beta mode) that allows you to showcase your Google Books bookshelves. It uses the Google Books API, and can show any of the default shelves: Reading Now, Favorites, Have Read or To Read as well as custom shelves. You can also choose the maximum number of books that you want to display.

I used some of the code from ZeroCool51's ([Bostjan Cigan](http://bostjan.gets-it.net "Bostjan Cigan")) plugin [Currently Reading Book](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/currently-reading-book/ "Currently Reading Book") for the admin area and [aharris88](http://adamwadeharris.com "aharris88")'s plugin [Google Bookshelves](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-bookshelves/ "Google Bookshelves") for the widget. 

What this plugin offers:

*   Widget for showing any number of book covers from any of your shelves.
*   Use shortcode to show a list of your books from any google books shelve including custom shelves in any post or page.
*   Php function that can be put into any template file

This is my first plugin and any feedback would be appreciated.
